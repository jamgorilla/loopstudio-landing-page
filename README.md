### What I learned

- How to structure your scss into partials - putting in resets and all styles, fonts etc in root then seperating out nav footers and lists in components
- using mixins
- using grid
- using media quieries nested in the selector - still wondering the best way to organise this on a bigger scale with more media queries
- How to code a hamburger menu animation
- You can use "order" to change the order of HTML markup

### Continued development

Still not completely comfortable with the way of thinking about responsive layouts as well as how to organise them once you start to have 4 or 5 different break points
Still having problems with rendenring fonts and changing their weight especially if they are not variable
Want to start encorporating react and wordpress into fututure projects and use some more javascript
